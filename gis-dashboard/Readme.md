# GIS dashboard

ChatGPT Rust

`
To create a complete graphics web UI GIS dashboard with features that can be programmed in any scripting runtime language, we will need to use multiple technologies and frameworks.

Here's an example implementation that uses the following components:

    Actix-Web for the web API
    Yew for the web UI
    WebAssembly as the target language for the web UI
    Python as the scripting runtime language
`


This code creates a Yew application with a GIS dashboard that allows the user to add points and polygons to the map and run Python code to add features. The Python code is executed in a separate process using the `std::process::Command` API, and the resulting GeoJSON is parsed and added to the GIS.

To use this application, you will need to replace `<your access token here>` in the `iframe` with your Mapbox access token. You will also need to have Python installed on your system and available on your `PATH`.

The application can be run using `cargo web start` and accessed in a web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.


To create a GIS WebUI dashboard in Rust where features can be programmed and saved in Python, we can use the following high-level architecture:

    Front-end: We will use a web framework such as Rocket or Actix-Web to create a user interface for the GIS dashboard. The front-end will use JavaScript and HTML/CSS to render the interface and interact with the server-side Rust code via RESTful API endpoints.

    Back-end: We will use Rust to implement the server-side logic for the GIS dashboard, including parsing GeoJSON data, rendering maps using Mapbox GL JS, and exposing RESTful API endpoints for the front-end to interact with.

    Scripting: We will use the Rust pyo3 crate to embed Python code in the Rust server, allowing users to programmatically manipulate and save data in the GIS dashboard.

Here's an outline of the steps we will need to follow to implement this architecture:

    Create a Rust project using Cargo and add dependencies for the web framework, serde for JSON parsing, and pyo3 for embedding Python code.

    Create a front-end interface for the GIS dashboard using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Use a library like Mapbox GL JS to render maps and interact with the back-end via RESTful API endpoints.

    Implement the server-side Rust code for the GIS dashboard. This will include:

        Parsing GeoJSON data using the serde crate and returning the parsed data as JSON via RESTful API endpoints.

        Rendering maps using Mapbox GL JS and returning the rendered map as an HTML page via a RESTful API endpoint.

        Exposing RESTful API endpoints for the front-end to interact with the server-side code, including endpoints for creating and modifying features in Python.

    Use the pyo3 crate to embed Python code in the Rust server, allowing users to programmatically manipulate and save data in the GIS dashboard.

    Test the GIS dashboard to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

    Deploy the GIS dashboard to a web server using a Docker container or another deployment method of your choice.

Note that this is a high-level overview of the steps involved in creating a GIS WebUI dashboard in Rust that allows features to be programmed and saved in Python. The implementation details will depend on the specific requirements of your project.
